Dear friends,
I apologize for the delay in the requested updates to the fdth package that I maintain.
Although I received email notices to make corrections, I was unable to correct in a timely
manner to avoid removal from the regular package list.

I hope everything is correct in this new (1.3-5) version of the package.
